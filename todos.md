# CodeDrills TODO list

1. Change userData GET method so we only get userData from the logged in username.

2. Figure out how to combine user info and quiz data so correct data for each user shows up on page.  
Probably will have to work over data schemas for relevant database endpoints.

3. Make user details page reflect actual username and password

4. Add user auth and register to include email to schema

5. Make sure quiz data is getting updated remotely and is being used to update the database.

6. Figure out how best to let the user create questions for his/her own account that others will not see,
but that he/she will see when taking tests.

7. Where are the user photos/avatars going to go?  Where can user upload selfie to?

8.
